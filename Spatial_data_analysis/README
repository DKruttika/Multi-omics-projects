##### directory contains scripts for analyzing spatial data from Akoya

Cell segmentation and clustering was done with STARdist and MIA (Akoya software)

### analysis for cell type counts in each sample ##

run the run_cell_type_summary_function_91123.sh script which runs the Rscript to get summarized counts of different cell types per sample
A single file for each sample is generated and stored in the ./summarized_results/ folder with the same name as original file (.dat extension)

Then merged all the .dat files into one using the paste_files.sh script in the ./summarized_results/ folder to generate the final data frame used in the 
downstream analysis: merged_cell_summary_akoya.txt

### python script run: .py to read in the matlab files (.mat)
